		  <p>Drawn by the majestic Douglas Fir and Western Red Cedar trees, early residents of the North Shore developed its first town site in the area now known as Lower Lonsdale. Rapid growth throughout 
		  the late 19th century precipitated first the incorporation of the District of North Vancouver in 1891, which stretched from Horseshoe Bay to Deep Cove. The separation of the City of North Vancouver 
		  in 1907 was a result of industrial growth and economic development in the Lower Lonsdale area.</p>
		  <p>Eighty years later, the North Shore community was introduced to Lonsdale Quay Market, an eclectic collection of vendors, artists and crafters. As the area continues to undergo transition from its 
		  industry-based roots to a new urban identity Lonsdale Quay Market upholds the sense of pioneer-inspired adventure that epitomizes living on Vancouver’s North Shore.</p>
		  <p>Today, Lonsdale Quay Market boasts 80 fresh food vendors, unique retail shops, artisans, restaurants, and a boutique hotel. Festivals and community events throughout the year ensure that no two visits
		  are the same. Whether it’s taking in a local band during an afternoon concert on the waterfront plaza, or braving the 77 steps to the top of the iconic Q Tower for the best view in the city, lasting memories 
		  are created daily at Lonsdale Quay Market.</p>
